# README

An MVP (minimal viable product) of a quiz application suited for web and mobile. Dev quiz's aim is to pose multiple choice questions that help users practice both basic and advanced fundamental knowledge of four lenguages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby. 

Problem it's solving: 
Create a quiz app using Rails, without scaffolding, that uses relational databases and javascript to quiz users in a multiple choice format on common coding knowledge and typical technical interview questions.

Technologies used: 
Ruby on Rails
Database relationships
JavaScript
SQLite3
HTML
CSS

Database uses seed file to create questions. We intend to advance qeution complexity of advanced questions and hit the target of questions asked most often in technical interviews as well.
